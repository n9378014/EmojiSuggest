### 🤔: How can I help or contribute to OpenMoji?

Contributions and help are very welcome! Please check the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) guide!

### 🤔: I would like to propose a new OpenMoji, how does this work?

Start a conversation on Github with us. For example [#84](https://github.com/hfg-gmuend/openmoji/issues/84) and [#97](https://github.com/hfg-gmuend/openmoji/issues/97)

### 🤔: The OpenMoji Black or Colorfont is not working as expected ... is this me?

⚠️ The colorfont version of OpenMoji is in a very early alpha stage and not intended to use in production! Please follow the [discussion](https://github.com/hfg-gmuend/openmoji/issues/93) for updates.

### 🤔: Is there an "emoji popup" or "emoji picker" available for OpenMoji?

No, we are sorry! This is simply out of scope. But all other ways to consume/use/download OpenMojis are listed under [Downloads & Distribution Channels](https://github.com/hfg-gmuend/openmoji#downloads--distribution-channels).

### 🤔: Does the OpenMoji project have a Contributor License Agreement (CLA)?

No. OpenMoji does not have an explicit Contributor License Agreement. We simply go with common practice of many open source projects: "inbound = outbound"! Every Github user already agrees to this via the [terms of service](https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service#6-contributions-under-repository-license) of Github:

> Whenever you make a contribution to a repository containing notice of a license, you license your contribution under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license your contribution under those terms. 

Full discussion and context in [#120](https://github.com/hfg-gmuend/openmoji/issues/120).

### 🤔: I suggested / proposed / asked for an Emoji ... but why is my name not listed as "author" of the new OpenMoji?

Because we decided that the authorship should go to the person who took actively care of everything in terms of making: sketching, designing, testing, iterating, discussing etc. until the new OpenMoji was accepted. Idealy the same person takes care of the entire pipeline from start to end. However if the initial suggestion was by a different person, we will acknowledge this is the changelog.txt file while still credit the "maker" as the author.
