`tile data objects`

Not all properties of `<Hexagon/>` are to be placed into a `tile data object` to be used in `<TiledHexagons/>`. The properties that DO carry over and should be placed into a `tile data object` are: `fill` `stroke` `shadow` `img` `text` `textStyle` `styles` `href` `target` `onClick`.

`tileStyles` and `tileTextStyles` apply a general styling to all hexagons, however, they can be overwritten by individual hexagons using `textStyle` and `styles`.

## Custom Styling
To customise a hexagon with CSS, pass through a `textStyle` or `styles` prop.
The `styles` prop is an object consisting of 3 objects: `normal` `hover` and `active`. The styles defined in each of these 3 objects are applied when the hexagon is in it's normal state, hover state and active state respectively.
For example, to make a yellow hexagon turn green when hovered and blue when clicked, you would pass the following object in the `styles` prop.
```js
{
  normal: {
    fill: 'yellow'
  },
  hover: {
    fill: 'green'
  },
  active: {
    fill: 'blue'
  }
}
```
